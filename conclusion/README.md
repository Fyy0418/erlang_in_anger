# Conclusion
Maintaining and debugging software never ends. New bugs and confusing behaviours will
keep popping up around the place all the time. There would probably be enough stuff out
there to fill out dozens of manuals like this one, even when dealing with the cleanest of all
systems.
<br>&emsp;I hope that after reading this text, the next time stuff goes bad, it won’t go too bad.
Still, there are probably going to be plenty of opportunities to debug production systems.
Even the most solid bridges need to be repainted all the time in order avoid corrosion to
the point of their collapse.
<br>&emsp;Best of luck to you.

&emsp;维护和调试软件的折腾永远不会有尽头。新的bugs和混乱的行为会不断涌现出来。即使是管理最简洁明了的系统，遇到的问题可能都足以写成几十个这样的手册。<br>
&emsp;我只希望阅读本文之后,下一次遇到问题,它不会太糟糕了。尽管如此,可能还是会有很多调试生产系统的机会。为了避免腐蚀点的崩溃，即便最坚实的桥梁需要重新粉刷。<br>
&emsp;祝你好运。
