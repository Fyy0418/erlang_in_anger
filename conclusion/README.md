# Conclusion
Maintaining and debugging software never ends. New bugs and confusing b ehaviours will
keep p opping up around the place all the time. There would probably b e enough stuff out
there to fill out dozens of manuals like this one, even when dealing with the cleanest of all
systems.
<br>&emsp;I hope that after reading this text, the next time stuff go es bad, it wonâ€™t go too bad.
Still, there are probably going to be plenty of opportunities to debug production systems.
Even the most solid bridges need to be repainted all the time in order avoid corrosion to
the point of their collapse.
<br>&emsp;Best of luck to you.
